          <div class="header">Environmental Sustainability</div>
          <div class="text">
            Environmental sustainability is essential if we wish to continue
            maintaining the daily resources we require. It affects all ecosystems in the world. Examples would be unpolluted
            air, clean water, fresh food, energy, and raw materials. As all of these daily necessities come
            from our environment, it's important to consider the effects of human activity. Whether it be hydraulic fracturing or even driving a car, the environment is 
            affected. Maintaining environmental sustainability means that we humans must cut back on the amount of natural resource we consume
            and refrain from damaging ecosystems.

          <div class="header right-align">Social Sustainability</div>
          <div class="text right-align">
            Social sustainability is when all members of a society have equal
            rights, share benefits, and have equal ground when deciding on
            significant changes. Additionally, resources should be
            consumed moderately and producing as little waste as possible. This
            can apply to all societies no matter how big or small. The big
            challenge of social sustainability is to both reduce consumption in the world
            while raising the standard of living.

          <div class="header">Economic Sustainability</div>
          <div class="text">
            Economic sustainability consists of the consequences of social
            and ecological effects from economic activity. We should understand
            the full life-cycle of our goods, from the extraction of raw
            materials, through processing, manufacture, distribution, use,
            maintenance, repair, and eventual recycling or disposal. Each step
            is more damaging than the previous and is a vicious cycle for the environment.
