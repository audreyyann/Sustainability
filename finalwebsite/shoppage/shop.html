            in 2017, over 16 million tons of textile waste was produced in
            America. synthetic materials can take over 30 years to break down,
            resulting in landfills filled with clothing. fast fashion also
            produces 1.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide a year, which
            contributes to global warming. clothes made sustainably are made
            ethically with eco-friendly materials that won’t pollute the Earth. </div>
