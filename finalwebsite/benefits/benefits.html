          - sustainable items are made with higher quality materials that last
          longer, meaning less waste in our landfills.
        </div>
        <div class="text-description2">
          - this also means reducing our carbon footprint!
        </div>
        <div class="text-description3">
          - products are fair trade, meaning they were ethically made without exploiting
          children or sweat shops.
        </div>
        <div class="text-description4">
          - the Fair Trade Movement (1940s) empowers workers and guarantees their rights
          as employees.

        <div class="text-description5">
          - the environment is prioritized by using eco-friendly materials and
          natural energy.
        </div>
        <div class="text-description6">
          - sustainability also means walking, biking, or skating more instead
          of driving cars that release CO2 and contribute to climate change.
        </div>
        <div class="text-description7">
          - the economy will benefit due to less consumption and localized
          production.
